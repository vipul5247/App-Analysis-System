# App-Analysis-System
Determining the scope and success of an android app for Google Play Store using Machine Learning in Python.

# Overview
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market! The model uses machine learning in python language.
The model will be providing insights to the App developers regarding various factors which would affect the success of the app and its scope in the market. The data set used is of Play Store for apps of different categories and through the information drawn from that, predictive analysis can be given which would help the android developers.

# Data Set: 
The data set used by the model provides all the necessary information for apps of various categories.
The attributes of the data set are:
1.	App: Application name
2.	Category: Category the app belongs to
3.	Rating: Overall user rating of the app (as when scraped)
4.	Reviews: Number of user reviews for the app (as when scraped)
5.	Size: Size of the app (as when scraped)
6.	Installs: Number of user downloads/installs for the app (as when scraped)
7.	Type: Paid or Free
8.	Price: Price of the app (as when scraped)
9.	Content Rating: Age group the app is targeted at - Children / Mature 21+ / Adult
10.	Genres: An app can belong to multiple genres (apart from its main category). For eg, a musical family game will belong to Music, Game, Family genres.
11.	Last Updated: Date when the app was last updated on Play Store (as when scraped)

Till now we have learnt about various libraries in Python including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and also about Data Visualisation and about statistical thinking. We have also learnt about classifications and regression techniques. Putting our knowledge we have learnt and are currently learning, we would implement this project and hope that this would be of use in real would as well!
